//! `changelog` is the underlying library behind the CLI tool `git-changelog`.
//!
//! The tool automates repository changelog generation without enforcing any git workflow
//! conventions. When developers wish to record a "user visible" change to the repository (e.g. new
//! feature, bug fix, breaking change, etc.) they can tag lines in their commit message with a few
//! keywords. These tags are then used to organize changes made to the repository into *scopes* and
//! *categories* and these organized changes can then be presented as pretty change-logs or release
//! notes. Commits messages without tags are quietly ignored and developers are free to tag as
//! little or as much as they want.
