# The out of the box configuration for git-changelog.  This
# file contains the configuration the tool runs with unless
# you override it by: (1) passing a `-c` or `--config`
# argument at the command line, or (2) adding a
# `.changelog.yml` file in your git repository.

## Project Conventions

# The category tags and their titles.

# Changes are grouped by title so you can put items tagged
# with different keywords (e.g. break and braek) into the
# same report section by giving them the same title.

# Items tagged with keywords not on the list (e.g. chore)
# will be skipped from the final report.

# The item with an empty string keyword applies to lines
# that have no explicit tags.

# The sequence of tag definitions here controls the order in
# which the tags will show up in the final report.
categories:
  - {keyword: "security", title: "Security Updates"}
  - {keyword: "break", title: "Breaking Changes"}
  - {keyword: "feature", title: "Features"}
  - {keyword: "fix", title: "Fixes"}
  - {keyword: "", title: "Notes"}
  - {keyword: "add", title: "Additions"}
  - {keyword: "remove", title: "Removals"}
  - {keyword: "deprecate", title: "Deprecations"}

# The scope tags and their titles.

# The scope configuration follows the same conventions as
# category. Remember that if you don't use scopes all items
# are tagged under the default scope (i.e. keyword="").
scopes:
  - {keyword: "", title: ""}
  - {keyword: "api", title: "API"}
  - {keyword: "doc", title: "Documentation"}

# The date format
date_format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
