[![Build Status]](https://travis-ci.org/aldrin/git-changelog)

`git-changelog` is a tool to automate repository [changelog] generation.

A commit [like this](resources/sample-commit.message) generates an output [like
this](resources/sample.md).

## Motivation

Commit messages must always be meaningful and with a little extra effort we can automate the chore
of generating meaningful change logs for end-users. As I finish up work on a change, I like to pause
a while, consider what the change means to the end-user and reorganize the message a bit. If you
follow the (easy) conventions described below and tag lines in the message appropriately, this tool
will help you generate an *accurate* and *presentable* change log.

A little time spent at the time of commit, when the context and impact of the change is fresh in
mind, saves a lot of time at release milestones.

## Installation

```bash
> cargo install git-changelog
```

If you use a Mac with [Homebrew], you may prefer the following:

```
> brew tap aldrin/tools
> brew install git-changelog
```

## Usage

Just write your commits as you [normally] do. When it looks like a particular commit includes a
change that the "user" may be interested in, tag it appropriately.

Concretely, instead of writing this:

```
Add support for filtering responses

UI gets a bit cluttered when the response contains too many
items. Added a simple filtering scheme to reduce the result
set to a more relevant subset. Clients using v1.2 need to
upgrade to accomodate the new request parameter.
```

Write this:

```
Add support for filtering responses

- feature: UI gets a bit cluttered when the response
  contains too many items. Added a simple filtering scheme
  to reduce the result set to a more relevant subset.

- break: Clients using v1.2 need to upgrade to accommodate
  the new request parameter.
```

They're both the same but the latter tags *user visible* changes diligently. Later, the tool picks
up these tags, aggregates similar tags (e.g. breaking changes) across commits, orders them, and
gives you a report that you can share, as is, with users. Or, you can use the output as the starting
draft, make editorial changes and then share it. Either way, it saves you some time.

Of course, you don't need to tag **every** commit (`git commit -m` is perfectly fine, where you
think it is). You just need to tag the changes you want your users to know about. The quality of the
tool output depends on the quality of *your* input.

## Generate reports

When `git-changelog` is on the path, `git changelog` works just like `git log` and takes the same
arguments. Concretely, it takes a [commit range] and looks for all commits in that range and uses
the tags it finds to generate a report. Simple. :)

```bash
> git changelog -h
git-changelog (v0.1.0)

A tool to automate project changelog generation.

USAGE:
    git-changelog [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [revision-range]...

FLAGS:
    -d, --debug      Prints debug logs
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <FILE>    Configuration file

ARGS:
    <revision-range>...    The revision range, defaults to HEAD...<last-tag>
```

The default revision range picks all commits made since the *last* tag.

## Customization

*Tags*: You can specify a configuration file to define the tags and scopes you want to use for your
project.  See the [default configuration file](resources/config.yml) for a starting example.

*Template*: You can specify a [Handlebars] template to control the rendered report format. The
[default template](resources/report.handlebars) generates a Markdown document that renders well on
Github.
