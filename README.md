[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aldrin/git-changelog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aldrin/git-changelog)

`git-changelog` is a tool to automate repository [changelog] generation.  

A commit [like this](resources/sample-commit.message) generates an output [like
this](resources/sample.md)

### Motivation

Commit messages must be meaningful in any case and with a little extra tidiness we can automate the
chore of generating change meaningful logs for end-users. As we finish up work on a change, I like
to pause a while, thing of what it means to the end-user and reorganize the message a bit. A little
time spent at commit time saves a lot of time at release milestones by bootstrapping an *accurate*
report of all work the done in the repository.

### Installation

```bash
> cargo install git-changelog
```

### Usage

Just write your commits as you [normally] do. When it looks like a particular commit includes a
change that the "user" may be interested in, tag it appropriately.

Concretely, instead of writing this:

```
Add support for filtering responses

UI gets a bit cluttered when the response contains too many items.
Added a simple filtering scheme to reduce the result set to a
more relevant subset. Clients using v1.2 need to upgrade to
accomodate the new request parameter.
```

Write this:

```
Add support for filtering responses

- feature: UI gets a bit cluttered when the response 
  contains too many items. Added a simple filtering scheme 
  to reduce the result set to a more relevant subset.

- break: Clients using v1.2 need to upgrade to accomodate
  the new request parameter.
```

They're both the same but the latter tags *visible* (from the user's perspective) changes. The tool
picks up these tags, gathers similar things (e.g. breaking changes) together and gives you a report
that you can share with users. Tags are optional, and you're free to tag as much or as little as you
see useful.

Of course, you don't need to do this for **every** commit (`git commit -m` is perfectly fine, where
it is). You just need to tag the change you want your users to know about.

#### Generate reports

To generate report you specify a [commit range] and the tool looks for all commits in the range and
uses the ones with the tags (ignoring others that don't) to generate a report.

```bash
Â» git changelog -h
git-changelog (v0.1.0)

A tool to automate project changelog generation.

USAGE:
    git-changelog [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [revision-range]...

FLAGS:
    -d, --debug      Prints debug logs
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <FILE>    Configuration file

ARGS:
    <revision-range>...    The revision range, defaults to HEAD...<last-tag>
```

The default revision range picks all commits made since the *last* tag.

#### Customization

- *Tags*: You can specify a configuration file to define the tags and scopes you want to use for
  your project.  See the [default configuration file](resources/config.yml) for a starting example.

- *Template*: You can specify a [Handlerbars] template to control the rendered report structure. The
  [default template](resources/report.handlebars) generates a Markdown document that renders well on
  Github.
